PowerBuilder 11 .NET Web Service Client Examples

This application demonstrates techniques for calling a number of public Web Services indexed at the Xmethods site at http://www.xmethods.net.  

To run a particular example, select the sample from the TreeView DataWindow to the left.  The General tab provides a brief overview of the service along with access to the Web Services Description Language (WSDL). The Invoke tab provides the user interface to execute the service.

None of the services used here requires registration; however, many of the vendors do have specific plans for commercial usage of their service.  Visit the Reference Link provided for each example (on the General tab) to access the specific terms of usage.

Disclaimer:
The inclusion of a Web Service in this example does not imply a specific endorsement or warranty of the functionality provided.  At the time this application was written, all of the services were operating correctly; however, since many of these services are the efforts of hobbyists, you may find that some fail to work correctly or have even ceased to exist.
