=============================
Section I: Before you install
=============================
PowerBuilder installs with two separate IDEs: PowerBuilder Classic 
and PowerBuilder .NET.

To install PowerBuilder .NET you first need to install Microsoft .NET 
Framework 4.0 that you can download from the Microsoft Web site. If you 
have an active internet connection when you install PowerBuilder, and you 
have not already installed the required .NET Framework version, Install 
PowerBuilder .NET Prerequisites installs it for you while it installs 
Microsoft Visual Studio Isolated Shell 2010.  

Install PowerBuilder .NET Prerequisites also installs the Microsoft 
Visual Studio Isolated Shell 2010 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 
Service Pack 1, which are required by the PowerBuilder .NET IDE. 
However, if you prefer, you can install the Isolated Shell and Visual 
Studio 2010 Service Pack 1 manually from the Support folder in the 
PowerBuilder installation ZIP file before you run the PowerBuilder 
setup program.

The installation of Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Service Pack 1 
also requires an active internet connection.

This Beta release is available as a set of zip files on the download 
page of the PowerBuilder 15 Beta Web site:

This release has been tested with SQL Anywhere 16.0. EAServer component 
has been tested with EAServer 6.3.1 with ESD#5. 

Installing the PBVM
-------------------
If you install EAServer on a different computer from PowerBuilder, you 
also need to install the PowerBuilder 15 version of the runtime DLLs 
(PBVM) required by the components you are using on that computer. To 
install the PBVM on a computer on which EAServer has already been 
installed, you can run the PBVM setup program on that computer from 
the PBVM directory extracted from PBVM.zip.

=====================================
Section II: Running the setup program
=====================================
You must have Administrator privileges to fully install this product.

1. Shut down any programs that are running.
   
2. If you want to use features that require SQL Anywhere, or
   Internet Explorer, install them before you install PowerBuilder.
   
   If you select SQL Anywhere in the common setup program, it is 
   installed before PowerBuilder and InfoMaker.  
   
   NOTE: You must shut down any earlier versions of SQL Anywhere 
   or Adaptive Server Anywhere engines that are running before
   installing SQL Anywhere 16.0.

3. Run the common setup program, select the components you want to
   install, and follow the instructions in the setup wizard.
  
4. When the common setup program completes, reboot your computer.

After installing, make sure that you have write access to the 
PowerBuilder 15.0 installation directory and to the Windows Registry.
