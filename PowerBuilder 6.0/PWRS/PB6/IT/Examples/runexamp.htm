<H3>Installing Sample Files</H3>

<P>Before running any of these examples, you must copy the following files
from the IT\Examples directory into a document directory on your HTTP (Web)
server: <BR>
(i.e. If you have installed WebSite, this directory defaults to C:\Website\htdocs)
</P>

<UL>
<LI>sample.htm </LI>

<LI>webpb.htm </LI>

<LI>winplug.htm </LI>

<LI>dwplug.htm </LI>

<LI>winplug.pbd </LI>

<LI>dwplug.psr </LI>

<H3>Preparing the Server Application For Networking</H3>

<P><B>Setting up the application's TCP/IP port</B> </P>

<P>To allow the PowerBuilder Web Examples Application server to run as
a TCP/IP application, you must assign it a TCP/IP port. To do this, you
must add the PowerBuilder application name to your network SERVICES file.
The file is called SERVICES (with no extension) and usually resides in
your Win95 directory. Windows NT users will find the SERVICES file in \WINNT\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS\ETC.
The reference you need to include should appear as follows: </P>

<PRE>        pb_net_examples 10098/tcp
</PRE>

<P>In our example line for your SERVICES file, found in <A HREF="servicpb.txt">servicpb.txt</A>,
we specify TCP port 10098. If that port is listed in your SERVICES file
as being occupied by another application, you must change the port to another
number that is not already in use. </P>

<P><B>Setting up the Application's CGI Interface</B> </P>

<P>To have the ability to execute these examples, the PowerBuilder Web
Server Application must be running, and the PowerBuilder Common Gateway
Interface (CGI) executable must be installed in a script/executable directory
on your Web (HTTP) server. </P>

<P>If you have installed WebSite, we will be placing the PowerBuilder CGI
executable in the Web server's /cgi-shl/ directory. If this is not your
configuration, then you must manually place the PowerBuilder CGI executable,
<TT>PBCGI60.EXE</TT> in a Web server script/executable directory. Once
you have installed the CGI executable in that directory, you must update
the links in the file <A HREF="webpb.htm">webpb.htm</A> to reflect this
new directory as well as update the instance variable is_CGIURL in user
object u_webpbexample that is part of the webpbsrv.pbl. We recommend rebuilding
the .exe and .pbd's if you make this change by using the project object
included in the .pbl. </P>

<P>For example, if I installed the file <TT>PBCGI60.EXE</TT> into an executable
directory on my Web server called <TT>scripts/</TT>, then I could do a
search and replace on <TT>cgi-shl/</TT> and replace it with <TT>scripts/</TT>.
</P>

<P>Once that change has been made, you should be able to load the sample
files from your Web server and follow the links to the samples. </P>

<HR><A NAME="db_prep"></A></P>

<H3>Preparing the Server Application for Database Access</H3>

<P>Some of these examples rely on SQL Anywhere 5.x, the Powersoft Demo
DB V6 and the Web.PB Class Library being installed in your system. The
ODBC datasource profiles that will be used for these connections are &quot;Powersoft
Demo DB V6&quot; and &quot;Powersoft WebPB&quot;. Please ensure that these
ODBC profiles still exist before running the server application. </P>

<P>NOTE: Turning off AutoStop Database in the required ODBC profiles will
ensure that the database remains running throughout your viewing of the
sample applications. </P>

<H3>Preparing the Server Application for Execution</H3>

<P>In order to run the server application, add a program shortcut to one
of the folders on your workspace. The shortcut should identify the server
application as the target, for example: &quot;C:\Program Files\powersoft\pb6\it\examples\webpbsrv.exe&quot;.
&nbsp;&nbsp;The starting directory should be the same as the one where
the program file is located, for example: &quot;C:\Program Files\powersoft\pb6\it\examples&quot;</P>

<P>In order for the server application to locate the PowerBuilder 6.0 virtual
machine DLLs, you must also add an entry to the Registry to identify the
application path. Use the Regedit program in&nbsp;Windows to add a new
key under <B>Hkey_Local_Machine\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App
Paths</B>. The key should be named <B>Webpbsrv.Exe</B> and its value should
identify the location of the PowerBuilder VM, for example: <B>C:\Program
Files\Powersoft\shared</B>.</P>

<H3>Preparing your Web Server for PB Plug-ins</H3>

<P>Before you can view the PB Plug-in examples, you must configure the
web server by registering the appropriate content types (MIME types) with
your Web server. <BR>
To Add the Plugins to WebSite's Content types (MIME types): <BR>
</P>

<OL>
<LI>Run the <B>WebSite Server Admin</B> program accessible via the <B>Start
Menu</B> or the the <B>WebSite Program Group</B><BR>
</LI>

<LI>Click on the Mapping tab. </LI>

<LI>Click on the Content Types radio button. </LI>

<LI>Type <B>.pbd</B> in the Field Extension (Class) entry field. </LI>

<LI>Type <B>application/vnd.powerbuilder6</B> in the MIME Content Type
entry field. </LI>

<LI>Click the Add button. </LI>

<LI>Type <B>.psr</B> in the Field Extension (Class) entry field. </LI>

<LI>Type <B>application/datawindow</B> in the MIME Content Type entry field.

<P>After all of the previous Installation Steps have been sucessfully completed!
</P>

<OL>
<LI>Run the Distributed PowerBuilder server application <B>Webpbsrv.exe</B>
from the IT\Examples directory.<BR>
</LI>

<LI>Start the WebSite server from the Start Menu in the WebSite 1.1 program
group by clicking on WebSite Server. You can tell the WebSite server is
running when the WebSite icon appears in the notification area of the taskbar.<BR>
</LI>

<LI>Open your favorite browser and open the following URL: <BR>

<P>If you find that from a Web browser you are unable to run these samples,
please review the installation steps on this page to ensure that all steps
have been completed successfully. </P>
